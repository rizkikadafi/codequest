                    <h3>Why They Matter?</h3>
                    <p>More than 90% of COVID-19 infections are concentrated in urban areas, with the most severe impact felt by the 1 billion inhabitants of densely populated slums worldwide. Even prior to the pandemic, rapid urbanization had placed over half of the global population, equivalent to 4 billion people, in cities grappling with deteriorating air quality, insufficient infrastructure and services, and unregulated urban expansion. The successful containment of COVID-19 in some instances underscores the remarkable ability of urban communities to adapt to evolving circumstances.</p>

                    <p>All of these challenges will inevitably impact each individual. Inequity may result in turmoil and instability, pollution negatively impacts the health of everyone and hinders the productivity of the workforce, thus impacting the overall economy, and natural disasters have the capacity to disrupt the lives of all.</p>

                    <h3>What Can I Do?</h3>
                    <p>Get involved in the administration and supervision of your urban area. Speak up for the type of city you think is necessary. Construct a plan for your residence, street, and local area, and put that plan into action. Are there sufficient employment opportunities? Is it secure for your children to walk to school? Can you take an evening stroll with your family? How accessible is public transportation? What is the state of air quality? What do the communal spaces look like? The more you enhance your community, the more significant the impact on your overall well-being.</p>
